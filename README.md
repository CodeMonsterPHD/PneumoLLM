## Get Started

**Training**

- Before training, please modify related parameters, e.g., exp_name, and check the related parameters, e.g., epochs, lr, batch_size, accum_iter.
- Replace the data file and llama model path

```bash
--data_root
--llama_model_path
```

```bash
run train_acc.py
```

**Validation**

- Before validation, please modify related parameters.

```bash
run eval_acc.py
```
